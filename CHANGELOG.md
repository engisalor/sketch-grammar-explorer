### âš  BREAKING CHANGES

This release is a complete rebuild of the package; it improves and simplifies API call management in a number of ways. 

- More modules, more customization, more logical workflows
- Caching has been offloaded to the [requests-cache package](https://github.com/requests-cache/requests-cache). 
- Methods from `0.5.5` are intact still but may later be deprecated. Import paths have also moved. 
- Unit testing has also been implemented; logging has been reduced to a minimum.

See current documentation for changes.
