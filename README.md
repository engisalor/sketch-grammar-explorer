## Introduction

Sketch Grammar Explorer (SGEX) is a Python package for using the [Sketch Engine](https://www.sketchengine.eu/) API. The goal is to develop a flexible scaffold for any kind of programmatic work with Sketch Engine and [NoSketch Engine](https://nlp.fi.muni.cz/trac/noske).

## Setup

Built with Python 3.10 and tested on 3.7.

**Installation**

- get a [Sketch Engine API key](https://www.sketchengine.eu/documentation/api-documentation/) (if using their server)

Install SGEX with pip:

- `pip install sgex`

Or manually:

- clone this repo
- install dependencies:
  - current versions `pip install -r requirements.txt`
  - required `pip install requests pyyaml`
  - optional `pip install keyring pandas openpyxl lxml`

**API credentials**

To configure SGEX, either run the code below or manually copy the example [config file](/config.yml) to your preferred directory.

```python
import sgex
sgex.Call(sgex.call_examples)
```

The config file contains API credentials and other settings for servers. Before making calls to a server, set up your credentials:

- if a server requires credentials, add a username and API key
- API keys can also be managed in the OS keyring with `sgex.config.keyring_add_key()` and `sgex.config.keyring_delete_key()` (in this case add a username in the config file and leave `api_key` as `null` or blank)

The default config file includes two servers: for Sketch Engine and a local NoSketch Engine installation. Add more as needed.

## Making API calls

To get started using example calls, generate an example input file by running `sgex.Parse(sgex.call_examples, "examples.yml")`. To make calls, run `sgex.Call()` with `input="examples.yml"` or another input file. Use the options below to make dry runs, set the server, etc.

``` python
import sgex

sgex.Parse(sgex.call_examples, "examples.yml")
job = sgex.Call("examples.yml")
```

**Options**

`input` a dictionary or path to a YAML/JSON file containing API calls

`output` save to sqlite (default `sgex.db`) or files: `json`, `csv`, `xlsx`, `xml`, `txt`

`dry_run` (`False`)

`skip` skip calls when a hash of the same parameters already exists in sqlite (`True`)

`clear` remove existing data before calls (sqlite table or `data/raw/`) (`False`)

`server` select a server from `config.yml` (`"ske"`)

`threads` for asynchronous calling (`None` for default, otherwise an integer)

`loglevel` (`"info"`) outputs to `.sgex.log`

### Saving results

Retrieved API data is stored in sqlite databases in `data/`. The default database is `sgex.db`; new databases are created when other filenames are supplied (always use the `.db` extension).

API responses can also be saved directly to `data/raw/` in supported file types (JSON, CSV, XLSX, TXT, XML) using `output="csv"`, etc. This will overwrite pre-existing data. JSON is the standard format for SkE and the only one with error reporting. 

Support for other formats generally depends on the shape of the data: e.g., `view` requires JSON and `freqs` accepts all file types. Additionally, NoSketch Engine servers may not output XLSX and can't use some call types (e.g., word sketch).

### Input files

**SGEX call structure**

One or more calls can be executed by creating an input file readable by SGEX that contains API calls in the form dictionaries of parameters.

- the key of each call serves as an id (`"call0"`)
- call types (frequency, concordance, etc.) are defined with `"type"`
- each call has a dictionary of API parameters in `"call"`
- calls can optionally contain metadata in `"meta"`
- `"keep"` can be used to save only a portion of response data (JSON only)

The call below queries the lemma "rock" in the [EcoLexicon English Corpus](https://www.sketchengine.eu/ecolexicon-corpus/) and retrieves frequencies by several text types.

**YAML**

Queries can be copied directly from YAML files into Sketch Engine's browser application without adding/removing escape characters.

```yml
call0:
  type: freqs
  meta:
    category1: tag1
  call:
    q:
    - alemma,"rock"
    corpname: preloaded/ecolexicon_en
    freq_sort: freq
    fcrit:
    - doc.domains 0
    - doc.genre 0
    - doc.editor 0
```

**JSON**

JSON requires consistent usage of double quotes and escape characters:

- interior double quotes escaped `"alemma,\"rock\""`, `"aword,\"it's\""`
- double-escaping for special characters: `"atag,1:\"N.*\" [word=\",|\\(\"]`

```json
{ "call0": {
    "type": "freqs",
    "meta": {
      "category1": "tag1"
    },
    "call":{
      "q": [
        "alemma,\"rock\""
      ],
      "corpname": "preloaded/ecolexicon_en",
      "freq_sort": "freq",
      "fcrit": [
        "doc.domains 0",
        "doc.genre 0",
        "doc.editor 0"]}}}
```

## Features

**Recycling parameters**

Parameters are reused unless defined explicitly in every call. For example, the job below contains three similar calls. Instead of writing out every parameter for each, only the first call is complete. The proceeding calls only contain new parameters to define.

Parameters can be passed through sequential calls of the same type. If `type` appears in a new call, nothing is reused. When parameters are part of a dictionary, its items are passed individually, whereas strings, lists, and other data types are replaced.

```yml

call0:
  type: freqs
  call:
    q:
    - alemma,"rock"
    corpname: preloaded/ecolexicon_en
    freq_sort: freq
    fcrit:
    - doc.domains 0

call1:
  call:
    q:
    - alemma,"stone"

call2:
  call:
    q:
    - alemma,"pebble"
```

**Skipping repeats**

If `skip=True`, a call won't be repeated when an identical call has already been made for a sqlite database. Repeats are identified using hashes of call dictionaries. If the contents of `"call"` change at all (even one character), they are considered unique calls. If `skip=False`, existing data is replaced when a new call has the same hash. Metadata does not affect hashes or call skipping.

**Asynchronous calling**

For local servers, asynchronous calling can increase performance substantially. Enable it by adding `asynchronous: True` to a server's details in `config.yml`. By default, the number of threads adjusts according to the number of CPUs available (see `max_workers` for [concurrent.futures](https://docs.python.org/3/library/concurrent.futures.html#concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor)). In this mode a job must finish before responses are saved.

**Discarding unwanted data with `keep`**

SGEX saves the entire response for each API call by default. Instead, `keep` can be used to specify what JSON data to save. For example, if `keep="concsize"` is set for `freqs` calls, only the absolute frequency is kept and the rest of the response is discarded. `keep` only works for top-level items, not nested data.

**Server wait times**

Servers may require waiting between calls. SGEX automatically manages waiting for the Sketch Engine server using their [Fair Use Policy](https://www.sketchengine.eu/fair-use-policy/) guidelines. If a custom server requires waiting, this can be enabled by adding a `wait` entry in the config file, like below:

```yml
ske:         # server name
  wait:      # wait dictionary (measured in seconds)
  0: 1       # wait = 0 for 1 call
  2: 99      # wait = 2 for 2-99 calls
  5: 899     # wait = 5 for 100-899 calls
  45: null   # wait = 45 for 900 or more calls
```

## Notes

**Working with different call types**

Each call type, `freqs` (frequencies), `view` (concordance), `wsketch` (word sketch), etc., has its own parameters and requirements: parameters are **not interchangeable** between call types but do share similarities.

**Too many requests**

Sketch Engine monitors API activity and will block excessive calls or other activity outside of their FUP. While learning the API, test calls selectively, slowly, and avoid repeated identical calls.

**API usage**

To learn more about the API, it's helpful to inspect network activity while making queries in Sketch Engine with a web browser (using Developer Tools). Importantly, Sketch Engine has internal API methods that only function in web browsers, so merely copy-pasting certain methods into SGEX won't necessarily work. Sketch Engine's API is also actively developed and syntax/functionalities may change.

**Double-checking accuracy**

Before relying heavily on the API, it's a good idea to practice trying the same queries both in a web browser and via API to make sure the results are identical.

**Saving and converting calls** 

`Parse()` is used to read API calls, but it can save call dictionaries and convert them to/from JSON and YAML files. Use `dest="<filepath>"` to save an object to file with the desired format.

**Logging and error handling**

- a bad response stops jobs immediately
- API errors are tracked when `output="json"` or a sqlite database
- `summary()` fetches job details from `Call` objects

Logging levels print the following information:

- `critical` - nothing
- `error` - TBD
- `warning` - each API error with its call id
- `info` - summary of a job and any API errors
- `debug` - everything

## About

SGEX has been developed to meet research needs at the University of Granada (Spain) Translation and Interpreting Department, in part to support the computational linguistics techniques that feed the [EcoLexicon](https://lexicon.ugr.es/) terminological knowledge base (see the articles [here](https://aclanthology.org/W16-4709/) and [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.05294.pdf) for an introduction).

The name refers to sketch grammars, which are series of generalized corpus queries in Sketch Engine that are useful for studying terminology and other lexical items (see their [bibliography](https://www.sketchengine.eu/bibliography-of-sketch-engine/)).

Questions, suggestions, and support are welcome.
